# Yesterblog

I created this tool to make it easy to host and manage a blog on [Yesterweb.org](https://yesterweb.org/)

It uses PHP 7.4.

# Features
- "Blogroll" homepage
- Login authentication (for edits)
- Post approval system
- Blog create/edit/view/delete
- Blog comments create/view/delete
- List page (lists entries)
- RSS feed automatically generated from approved posts
- Created 'About' page (with auto-generated contributors)

# Kewl extra stuff I added
- Main feed & individual view will display # of comments
- Alternative "blogroll" with excerpts and 'read more' links (/excerpt.php)
- Added lil widget to display 3 post previews at random under comment section.
- Added doodad that displays a Yesterweb webring member at random on the sidebar.

# To do
